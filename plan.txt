Text structure:
  Lists separator: 2 lines
  Items separator: 1 line

The way:
  1. read the text from clipboard
  [error point] if there isn't a text, print "there isn't any copied text"

  2. separate Lists
  [error point] if len(lists) != 2, print "lists aren't separated correctly"

  3. separate items
  [error point] if len(items) lists isn't equal, print "list {n} has {len(items) of list {n}}" for each list, to tell the user where is the reduction.

  4. add items one to one from this 2 lists and separate them with ","
      separate each 2 items with a line

  5. save final result to the clipboard then
      print "Done\nSaved to clipboard"
